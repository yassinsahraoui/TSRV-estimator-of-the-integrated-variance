# TSRV estimator of the integrated variance

This repository contains the implementation of the Monte Carlo Simulation of section 7 of Zhang et al. (2005). We provide the code of the: 

1. Monte Carlo simulation of the Heston model using Euler discretization scheme at a time interval Δt=1 second to discretize the Heston SDEs. 

2. Implementation of the various indicators presented in Zhang et al. (2005) paper : RV, RV sparse, TSRV.

3. Obtained results in terms of bias, variance and RMSE.
